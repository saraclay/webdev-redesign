<h2>ITP104 Introduction</h2>

<h4>Web pages and Web Publishing</h4>

What is involved in Web pages?
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Content such as text, hyperlinks, images, video and audio</li>
	<li>Page "code" such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript</li>
	<li>Server-Side scripting such as ASP/.Net, PHP, ColdFusion, etc.</li>
	<li>Programming such as Perl or Java. Side technologies and endeavors such as databases, e-commerce, security, et al.</li>
	<li>Actual server machines, networks, routers and switches, connections, etc.</li>
</ul>

<br>
ITP104 focuses on "Web Publishing"? What is Web Publishing? Is that different from Web Development? From above, Web publishing focuses mainly on HTML and CSS, with a little bit of interactivity through Javascript or jQuery.

<br><br>
A closer look at ITP104 -- Syllabus and Course Calendar
<br><br>
<h4>Course goals</h4>

Each week students will learn more about web page creation, HTML and CSS. They will progress from creating basic output to designing layouts and pages, adding interactivity, and adding advanced elements.
<br><br>
By the end of the semester each student will be proficient in basic Web publishing using HTML and CSS and will build a full website featuring interactive pages, graphics and layouts they created, and hosted and publicly accesible on the USC server.
<br><br>
What can you "build" with only one semester of instructions? Some samples of past ITP104 final projects...
<br><br>

Ok let's back up a step -- what is the Internet?

<br><br>
<h4>Background -- the Internet "network" and activities, the Web, and Web Publishing</h4>

Internet = Web? No. The Internet is the “network” you “use” to send and receive different kinds of data such as Web pages, email messages, real-time chat messages, multiplayer gaming information, files (file transfers), etc.
<br><br>
How the Web works: From the Internet "network" and activities you perform on it, to how web URLs and requests work, to the basics of a Webpage file.
<br><br>
What does your browser do when it requests a web page? It asks a web server for a SINGLE FILE that is in a web page format such as html. Web URLs are requests for SINGLE web pages/files from a specific machine on the Internet (a Web server).
<br><br>
Ok so then what is that domain part of a request? How do domains work?
<br><br>
A Web browser sends an http (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or https request to a web server by resolving the servers's domain to an IP (Internet Protocol) address (like 128.125.121.22). The Web server responds by sending back the (HTML) document that was requested. The browser then displays the file graphically according to its HTML and CSS instructions.
<br><br>
Whew. Ok for an animated explanation of the mechanics of how a web request and response works, networks, switchers, routers and firewalls... dawn of the net
<br><br>
Following up on tha video, what happens when you request a web page -- file is delivered back to your computer and interpreted by your Web browser. What is the difference between browsers such as Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome and Firefox? What do they all basically do?
<br><br>
Well, what is a Web page file, what is it made of? Text and “tags”.
<br><br>
Browsers request text files (saved with special “html” file extensions), read the file, and then graphically display the contents.
<br><br>
Why? Can we just put “text” in a web page? .txt versus .html?
<br><br>
What is html? Pages are “text and tags”.
<br><br>
You can view the “source” of any web page to see that text file behind the page. But who would want to view a “web page” in that “code” mode?
<br><br>
So what does it take to create a web page? Well, we can take a whole bunch of text, save it as a file with an html extension (text.html), and view it in a web browser. But it’s just a large wall of text with no formatting or whatnot. See the plaintext lecture1.html version of this lecture with no HTML (but saved as a web page).

<br><br>
Next week... you create your first web page! And upload it to the USC server (so you can show it off to family and friends).
